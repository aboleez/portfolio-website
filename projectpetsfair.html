                    <p>I studied Pet Bubs, Pet Match, Monkoodog and many similar apps . This helped me to not only
                        understand the competitors but also get inspired and observe the issues in these apps, which I
                        could overcome.</p>

                            <p>I have used low-fidelity prototypes to conduct usability test with three users. There
                                were few negative and positive feedbacks. But all in all they were happy with the app
                                flow and could easily go through the app. This helped me improvising on my user
                                experience of the app.</p>

                                <li>There is no way I could see the petâ€™s health details, which I would want to know
                                    thoroughly and in detail when I am looking at the pet profile</li>
                                <li>I would want to know what document would work for verification in adoption form

                                <li>Reading of terms and conditions is mandatory for me before I proceed to filling the
                                    adoption form.</li>

                                <li>I just loved the playful and fresh feel of the app.</li>
                                <li>I really liked the feature of primary care and considering my own experience as a
                                    pet parent I am sure this would be the most used feature of the app.</li>
                                <li>This app will surely promote pet adoption since it will be really a convenient
                                    process henceforth.</li>

                            <p>The design itself is one learning process. There were may situations which were difficult
                                in application especially designing within the system guidelines. But with the help of
                                my tutor and bit of a research helped me understand the system guidelines better. The
                                before hand planning of the moodboard gave me clarity about how I expect the tone and
                                mood of the app should be.Learning from case studies of competitive service providers
                                and apps helped in broadening my knowledge about the subject but also finding a scope of
                                improvement in the app I planned to design.</p>
